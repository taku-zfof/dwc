An Object.assign shim. Invoke its "shim" method to shim Object.assign if it is unavailable.

This package implements the [es-shim API](https://github.com/es-shims/api) interface. It works in an ES3-supported environment and complies with the [spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-object.assign). In an ES6 environment, it will also work properly with `Symbol`s.

Takes a minimum of 2 arguments: `target` and `source`.
Takes a variable sized list of source arguments - at least 1, as many as you want.
Throws a TypeError if the `target` argument is `null` or `undefined`.

Most common usage:
```js
var assign = req
